title: Pull Request Validation using Scratch Org with Package Install Validation
category: Pipelines
order: 2
---

This pipeline demonstrates how you can build a pull request validation pipeline using scratch orgs. The intent of this pipeline is to validate a pull/merge request into the integration branch upon completion of a feature branch by developers.

This pipeline is triggered on every pull request raised against a develop/master branch depending on your git flow.
